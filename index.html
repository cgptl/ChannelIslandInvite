                <h2>Join the team on MLK Jr Weekend</h2>
                <p>
                        I'm pretty sure it'll be loads of fun. Just don't get sunburned.

                        Typical departure time is 9 AM; show up by 8:20 as a precaution. The boat leaves the island at 3:30 PM, so don't miss it!

                        It's not going to stop this little fella's friends from stealing it, but be on your guard and you should be fine. Just keep in mind they're all quite cunning. Like a fox.

                        Take a nice hike along the cliffs at your own pace and enjoy the view. There's a lot to see; you could spot a cool bird or just heckle the kayakers.

                        And while you're at it, watch this idiot pretend he's not seasick. Don't worry, though. It's a lot better when you're out in open air.
